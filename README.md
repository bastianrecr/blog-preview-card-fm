## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I reinforced my understanding of font management and the use of different font file types. Specifically:

- I learned the difference between **static fonts** and **variable fonts**:
  - Static fonts have predefined weights (e.g., SemiBold, ExtraBold).
  - Variable fonts allow setting any weight within a range (usually 100â€“900) using a single file.
- I also practiced organizing font imports efficiently by defining `@font-face` rules that allow targeting specific weights and styles using both static and variable font files.

This helped me understand better when to choose one or the other depending on the project requirements.

### Continued development

In future projects I would like to:

- Deepen my understanding of when to prefer variable fonts for performance optimization.
- Continue improving the structure and maintainability of my CSS, especially using BEM more consistently.

### Useful resources

- [BEM Guidelines](https://getbem.com/introduction/) - Great reference for writing maintainable CSS using BEM methodology.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Always helpful for HTML/CSS reference.
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - Resource where I continue learning best practices for web development.
